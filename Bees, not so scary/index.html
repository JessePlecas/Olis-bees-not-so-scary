        <p>Bees are insects that have many important purposes. Bees help to pollinate flowers, which is how they can bloom and grow more.
        They also make honey, which most of us use every day. Bees are needed if humans want to survive.</p>

        <h2>What does a bee look like?</h2>
            <p>Bees belong to the insect family which means that they have six legs and three parts to their body; the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Their bodies are short and thick and are covered with fluffy hair. Bees are different from wasps because they have small combs on thei arms to help them clean their antennae</p>

        <h2>What do bees eat?</h2>
            <p>Bees eat nectar and pollen from flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that gives the bees energy. Pollen is the yellow powder that comes from flowers and the bees use this to feed their babies which are called larvae.</p>

        <h2>How do bees protect themselves?</h2>
            <p>The first thing a bee will do to protect itself, is build it's hive in a safe and secret spot so no one will bother them. The other way a bee defends itself is with a stinger! A bee will only sting you if the bee feels threatened or afraid, so it's generally best to leave them alone. Female bees have a stinger on the end of their body and they use it to sting something that might be threatening the bee. The stinger comes out of the bees body and stays in the victim, this kills the bee. A bee sacrifices itself to protect the hive and queen bee, they will not sting you if you leave them alone.</p>
